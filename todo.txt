Character:
write new user information into file
check if username already taken using text file like Characters.txt (eventually use tree to store characters)
encrypt password
get login working 
add methods for what books character has checked out, and what books character is waiting on
when prgrm starts, write all the stuff from txt files into ArrayLists to make it easier to search for (also helps to implement different types of sorts)
Later: due dates for books?

Driver:
access existing memberships to know which books which person has checked out (work w/ Character to get file of existing usernames and encrypted passwords.
ability to see existing books (with filters? By letter, by author)
ability to checkout (type checkout and enter)
ability to return (type return and enter)
Later: program wide thingy where library knows which user has which books, even if user isn't currently using prgrm.

Book:
when called, create a new ArrayList to represent the waiting list.
bool var: available -- this means that books will never be erased from the directory; available will just be set to false.
*QUEUE* after we get ArrayList working
