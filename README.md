===================================

Hello there, fair user!
We've toiled long and hard to present you with our brainchild, THE LIBRARY SIMULATOR!
Travel back in time to the prehistoric age (read: the early 2000's), and marvel at the accuracy and speed with which we've brought the library to your home! Smell the old, weathered pages of the fake, digital books! Unlike real libraries, we won't even charge you late fees! Please enjoy this blast from the past, as we venture to infinity and beyond.

Basically, all the instructions happen right when you run our program.

heads up, fair user! We'd love for you to run the LATEST VERSION OF OUR PROJECT.
Running v1 would not be that fun for you. Seriously. It would suck.
